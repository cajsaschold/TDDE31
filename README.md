# Big Data Analytics
This repository contains assignments from the Big Data Analytics (BDA1 & BDA2) course, focusing on Apache Spark, Spark SQL, and Machine Learning. The tasks involve processing large-scale weather datasets, performing data transformations, aggregations, and predictive modeling.

## Contents

### 1. Spark Exercises (BDA1)
- Implements Apache Spark (RDD-based) solutions for weather data analysis.
- Tasks include extreme temperature detection, high-temperature counts, station-based monthly averages, and precipitation analysis.
- Optimizations include data filtering, caching, and distributed processing.
### 2.Spark SQL Exercises (BDA2)
- Replicates BDA1 exercises using Spark SQL.
- Utilizes built-in API functions for efficient querying and aggregation.
- Focuses on structured data processing and optimization techniques.
### 3. Machine Learning for Big Data
- Implements a kernel-based temperature prediction model using PySpark.
- Uses Gaussian kernels to model spatial, temporal, and hourly variations.
- Applies additive and multiplicative kernels to compare predictive performance.
- Optimized using RDD caching and data broadcasting.
