# Big Data Analytics
Assignments on big data processing, Spark SQL, and machine learning using Apache Spark. The projects analyze weather data by leveraging distributed computing, RDD transformations, Spark SQL queries, and Gaussian kernel models.

## Contents

### 1. Spark Exercises (BDA1)
- Implements Apache Spark (RDD-based) solutions for weather data analysis.
- Tasks include extreme temperature detection, high-temperature counts, station-based monthly averages, and precipitation analysis.
- Optimizations include data filtering, caching, and distributed processing.
### 2.Spark SQL Exercises (BDA2)
- Replicates BDA1 exercises using Spark SQL.
- Utilizes built-in API functions for efficient querying and aggregation.
- Focuses on structured data processing and optimization techniques.
### 3. Machine Learning for Big Data
- Implements a kernel-based temperature prediction model using PySpark.
- Uses Gaussian kernels to model spatial, temporal, and hourly variations.
- Applies additive and multiplicative kernels to compare predictive performance.
- Optimized using RDD caching and data broadcasting.
